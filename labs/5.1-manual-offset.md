## Depends On

## Run time

20 mins

## Step-1 : Consumer

Inspect file : `src/main/java/x/lab5_offsets/ManualOffsetConsumer.java`  

Fix the **TODO-1**

Disable auto commit like this

```java
props.put("enable.auto.commit", "false");
```

**Run the consumer in Eclipse**, by

* Right click on file
* Run as 'Java Application'

## Step-2 : Producer

On a terminal, start console producer

```bash
    $    ~/apps/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
        --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test
```

Send events

```text

```

## Step-3: Inspect the output from Consumer

You will see consumer processing messages.

Pay special attention to OFFSETs.

Now **stop the consumer** program

## Step-4: Rerun the consumer

Consumer will start up, but there will be no more messages received.

**Now input some more data from producer**

```text
4
5
6
```

**Observe the consumer output, you will see these messages**

**Stop the consumer**

## Step-5: Enable commitSync

Uncomment the following line to enable commitSync

```java
consumer.commitSync();
```

## Step-6: Rerun consumer

* Re-run consumer again
* Observe what data it is getting
* stop the consumer
* Start the consumer again.
* Observe the data.  What do you see?  Is it still getting 'old data'?
